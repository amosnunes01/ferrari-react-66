# Background Images

Place the following image files in this directory so the app can display them:

- `ferraricover.jpg` — used on the home slide instead of the video
- `ferrari_racing.jpg` — used on the racing slide instead of the video

These should be the appropriate JPG versions of the video backgrounds. If you don't provide them the sections will be blank or show a 404.
